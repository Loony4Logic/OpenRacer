**OpenRacer** is an open-source platform that empowers you to train machine learning models for autonomous racing. Built with Python and powered by a Unity-based 3D environment, OpenRacer offers a dynamic and accessible way to develop and test AI models in a simulated racing environment.

## üöÄ Features

- **Python-Powered Training**: Use Python to develop, train, and fine-tune your machine learning models.
- **3D Unity Environment**: Experience immersive simulations with our Unity-based 3D racing environment, which connects to Python via WebSocket.
- **Custom Track Creation**: Generate your own tracks using coordinates provided by the server, or use premade tracks.
- **Real-Time Progress Monitoring**: Visualize your model's training progress and racing performance through an integrated web interface with live updates and detailed graphs.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Easily adjust hyperparameters to optimize your model's performance.
- **Open-Source Flexibility**: Customize and extend the platform to suit your unique needs, thanks to its fully open-source codebase.

## üéØ Impact

**"Democratizing Autonomous Racing: Empowering Innovators and Learners to Shape the Future of AI."**

OpenRacer is designed to lower the barrier to entry for autonomous racing and machine learning. Whether you're a hobbyist, a student, or a professional, our platform provides the tools you need to experiment, learn, and innovate in the field of AI.
